# AI-Programming-with-Python-Nanodegree-Program

Learn the essential foundations of AI: the programming tools (Python, NumPy, PyTorch), the math (calculus and linear algebra), and the key techniques of neural networks (gradient descent and backpropagation).

## Introduction to Python
Start coding with Python, drawing upon libraries and automation scripts to solve complex problems quickly.

## Jupyter Notebooks, NumPy, Anaconda, pandas, and Matplotlib
Learn how to use all the key tools for working with data in Python: Jupyter Notebooks, NumPy, Anaconda, pandas, and Matplotlib.

## Linear Algebra Essentials
Learn the foundational linear algebra you need for AI success: vectors, linear transformations, and matricesâ€”as well as the linear algebra behind neural networks.

## Calculus Essentials
Learn the foundations of calculus to understand how to train a neural network: plotting, derivatives, the chain rule, and more. See how these mathematical skills visually come to life with a neural network example.

## Neural Networks
Gain a solid foundation in the hottest fields in AI: neural networks, deep learning, and PyTorch.
