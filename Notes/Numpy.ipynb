    "## Why Use NumPy?\n",
    "\n",
    "You may be wondering why people use NumPy - after all, Python can handle lists, as you learned in the Intro to Python lessons.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even though Python lists are great on their own, NumPy has a number of key features that give it great advantages over Python lists. One such feature is speed. When performing operations on large arrays NumPy can often perform several orders of magnitude faster than Python lists. This speed comes from the nature of NumPy arrays being memory-efficient and from optimized algorithms used by NumPy for doing arithmetic, statistical, and linear algebra operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another great feature of NumPy is that it has multidimensional array data structures that can represent vectors and matrices. You will learn all about vectors and matrices in the Linear Algebra section of this course later on, and as you will soon see, a lot of machine learning algorithms rely on matrix operations. For example, when training a Neural Network, you often have to carry out many matrix multiplications. NumPy is optimized for matrix operations and it allows us to do Linear Algebra operations effectively and efficiently, making it very suitable for solving machine learning problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another great advantage of NumPy over Python lists is that NumPy has a large number of optimized built-in mathematical functions. These functions allow you to do a variety of complex mathematical computations very fast and with very little code (avoiding the use of complicated loops) making your programs more readable and easier to understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "These are just some of the key features that have made NumPy an essential package for scientific computing in Python. In fact, NumPy has become so popular that a lot of Python packages, such as Pandas, are built on top of NumPy.\n"

    "## Creating and Saving NumPy ndarrays\n",
    "\n",
    "At the core of NumPy is the **ndarray**, where nd stands for n-dimensional. An ndarray is a multidimensional array of elements all of the same type. In other words, an ndarray is a grid that can take on many shapes and can hold either numbers or strings. In many Machine Learning problems you will often find yourself using ndarrays in many different ways. For instance, you might use an ndarray to hold the pixel values of an image that will be fed into a Neural Network for image classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "But before we can dive in and start using NumPy to create ndarrays we need to import it into Python. We can import packages into Python using the `import` command and it has become a convention to import NumPy as `np`. Therefore, you can import NumPy by typing the following command in your Jupyter notebook: "

Therefore, we refer to a 2D array as a rank 2 array. Another important property of arrays is their shape. The shape of an array is the size along each of its dimensions. For example, the shape of a rank 2 array will correspond to the number of rows and columns of the array. As you will see, NumPy ndarrays have attributes that allow us to get information about them in a very intuitive way. For example, the shape of an ndarray can be obtained using the `.shape` attribute. `The shape attribute returns a tuple of N positive integers that specify the sizes of each dimension`. In the example below we will create a rank 1 array and learn how to obtain its shape, its type, and the data-type (dtype) of its elements."

For this reason, in the cases where non-integer steps are required, it is usually better to use the function `np.linspace()`. The `np.linspace(start, stop, N)` function returns `N` evenly spaced numbers over the closed interval `[start, stop]`. This means that both the `start` and the`stop` values are included. We should also note the `np.linspace()` function needs to be called with at least two arguments in the form `np.linspace(start,stop)`. In this case, the default number of elements in the specified interval will be N= 50. The reason `np.linspace()` works better than the `np.arange()` function, is that `np.linspace(`) uses the number of elements we want in a particular interval, instead of the step between values.

The `np.reshape(ndarray, new_shape)` function converts the given `ndarray` into the specified `new_shape`.

For example, you can convert a rank 1 ndarray with 6 elements, into a 3 x 2 rank 2 ndarray, or a 2 x 3 rank 2 ndarray, since both of these rank 2 arrays will have a total of 6 elements. However, you can't reshape the rank 1 ndarray with 6 elements into a 3 x 3 rank 2 ndarray, since this rank 2 array will have 9 elements, which is greater than the number of elements in the original ndarray.

    "In some cases, you may need to create ndarrays with random numbers that satisfy certain statistical properties. For example, you may want the random numbers in the ndarray to have an average of 0. NumPy allows you create random ndarrays with numbers drawn from various probability distributions. The function `np.random.normal(mean, standard deviation, size=shape)`, for example, creates an ndarray with the given `shape` that contains random numbers picked from a `normal` (Gaussian) distribution with the given `mean` and `standard deviation`. Let's create a 1,000 x 1,000 ndarray of random floating point numbers drawn from a normal distribution with a mean (average) of zero and a standard deviation of 0.1."

NumPy ndarrays are mutable, meaning that the elements in ndarrays can be changed after the ndarray has been created. NumPy ndarrays can also be sliced, which means that ndarrays can be split in many different ways. This allows us, for example, to retrieve any subset of the ndarray that we want. Often in Machine Learning you will use slicing to separate data, as for example when dividing a data set into training, cross validation, and testing sets.\n",

    "As we mentioned earlier, in addition to being able to access individual elements one at a time, NumPy provides a way to access subsets of ndarrays. This is known as slicing. Slicing is performed by combining indices with the colon `:` symbol inside the square brackets. In general you will come across three types of slicing:\n",

    "`2. ndarray[start:]`\n",

The third method is used to select all elements from the first index till the `end` index. We should note that in methods one and three, the end index is excluded. We should also note that since ndarrays can be multidimensional, when doing slicing you usually have to specify a slice for each dimension of the array.\n",

Like with other functions we saw before, the `sort` function can also be used as a method. However, there is a big difference on how the data is stored in memory in this case. When `np.sort()` is used as a function, it sorts the ndrrays out of place, meaning, that it doesn't change the original ndarray being sorted. However, when you use `sort` as a method, `ndarray.sort()` sorts the ndarray in place, meaning, that the original array will be changed to the sorted one. Let's see some examples:"

    "## Arithmetic operations and Broadcasting\n",
    "\n",
    "We have reached the last lesson in this Introduction to NumPy. In this last lesson we will see how NumPy does arithmetic operations on ndarrays. NumPy allows element-wise operations on ndarrays as well as matrix operations. In this lesson we will only be looking at element-wise operations on ndarrays. In order to do element-wise operations, NumPy sometimes uses something called Broadcasting. `Broadcasting is the term used to describe how NumPy handles element-wise arithmetic operations with ndarrays of different shapes`. For example, broadcasting is used implicitly when doing arithmetic operations between scalars and ndarrays.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start by doing element-wise addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, between ndarrays. To do this, NumPy provides a functional approach, where we use functions such as `np.add()`, or by using arithmetic symbols, such as `+`, that resembles more how we write mathematical equations. Both forms will do the same operation, the only difference is that if you use the function approach, the functions usually have options that you can tweak using keywords. It is important to note that when performing element-wise operations, the shapes of the ndarrays being operated on, must have the same shape or be broadcastable. We'll explain more about this later in this lesson. Let's start by performing element-wise arithmetic operations on rank 1 ndarrays:"
